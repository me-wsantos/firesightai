## üéØ Predictive Model Endpoint on Azure

At the heart of our predictive system is a **Machine Learning model deployed as a real-time REST endpoint** in **Azure Machine Learning Studio**. This enables the system to provide on-demand wildfire risk scoring for any given location.

## üìä Data Source

The performance of a Machine Learning model is directly dependent on the quality of its training data. This document outlines the methodological process used to construct the `dataset_final.csv` file ‚Äî a robust and balanced dataset containing examples of conditions **with** and **without** fire occurrences.

---

### üî• Class 1: Points **WITH** Fire (`Target = 1`)

The first step was to gather a comprehensive sample of locations and times where fires were detected.

### 1.1. Obtaining Ignition Points

To ensure broad geographical coverage, we relied on two primary data sources:

| Region   | Data Source            | Link                                         |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| üáßüá∑ Brazil   | NASA FIRMS (USFS)       | [firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov) |
| üáßüá∑ Brazil | INPE Queimadas         | [dataserver-coids.inpe.br](https://dataserver-coids.inpe.br)          |

These sources provided the essential fire event data: **latitude**, **longitude**, **date**, and **time of detection**.

### 1.2. Enrichment with Meteorological Data

An ignition point alone is not enough ‚Äî we must understand the **weather conditions** at the exact time of the event. For that, we used the following API:

- **API Used**: [Open-Meteo Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com)

For each fire point, we called this API using the **latitude**, **longitude**, **date**, and **time**, retrieving variables such as:

- Temperature  
- Relative humidity  
- Precipitation  
- Wind speed  
- And more


### üå≤ Class 2: Points **WITHOUT** Fire (`Target = 0`)

Creating the "no fire" class is a challenge. Simply selecting random points on the map could introduce bias, as geographic and seasonal conditions would vary. To solve this, we adopted a **Time-Shift** strategy.

### 2.1. The Time-Shift Strategy

- **Coordinate Reuse**: For each Class 1 point, we reused the same **latitude** and **longitude**.
- **Temporal Shift**: We subtracted **15 days** from the original fire event date.
- **Weather Enrichment**: We called the same Open-Meteo API to fetch meteorological data for this new time (same location, 15 days earlier).

> üí° This technique allows us to create an almost perfect counterexample: the **same location**, observed at two **different moments** ‚Äî one with fire and one, presumably, without. This helps the model focus on the **weather variations** that lead to ignition.

### 2.2. Challenges and Solutions

- **API Limitation**: The Open-Meteo API allows up to **10,000 requests per day**.
- **Solution**: A script was developed to automate data collection over multiple days, with programmed pauses to comply with the daily limit.


### üîó Final Dataset Merge and Cleaning

Once both classes were built, the following steps were performed:

- **Action**: The "with fire" and "without fire" datasets were combined.
- **Integrity Check**: We ensured that **no point** (same latitude, longitude, and date) appeared in both classes at the same time.


### ‚úÖ Result

The result of this meticulous process is the `dataset_final.csv` file:  
A **clean, balanced, and enriched** dataset that served as the foundation for training all of our prediction models in **Azure Machine Learning**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compute Infrastructure

To handle training and evaluation with high-volume meteorological datasets from **NASA FIRMS** and **NOAA**, a powerful compute instance was provisioned on Azure ML.

- **SKU:** `Standard_D2as_v4`  
- **Quota Type:** Dedicated  
- **Purpose:** High-performance CPU and memory balance, ideal for time-series model training.

## üåç Execution Environment

Reproducibility and consistency are crucial in ML workflows. We containerized the model training and scoring environment using **Docker** and **Conda**, ensuring consistent results across local development, cloud training, and inference.

### üê≥ Docker Environment

We built a custom Docker image using an official Azure ML base optimized for PyTorch and distributed computing. Key components:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu22.04:20250601.v1

WORKDIR /

ENV CONDA_PREFIX=/azureml-envs/designer-pytorch-2.3-train
ENV CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV=$CONDA_PREFIX
ENV PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin:$PATH
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

COPY conda_dependencies.yaml .

RUN conda env create -p $CONDA_PREFIX -f conda_dependencies.yaml -q && \
    rm conda_dependencies.yaml && \
    conda run -p $CONDA_PREFIX pip cache purge && \
    conda clean -a -y
```
### üêç Conda Environment

Dependencies are pinned to exact versions in a conda_dependencies.yaml file to ensure compatibility and reproducibility.

```YAML
name: project_environment
dependencies:
  - python=3.9.22
  - pip:
    - azureml-train-automl-runtime==1.60.0
    - inference-schema

```

### ‚ö° API Gateway with Azure Functions

While Azure ML endpoints offer secure scoring capabilities, exposing them directly to clients is not recommended. To mitigate this, we implemented a serverless API Gateway using Azure Functions.

| Component            | Detail                                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Function App Name**| `fire-endpoint`                                            |
| **Default Domain**   | `https://fire-endpoint.azurewebsites.net`                 |
| **Hosting Plan**     | `Flex Consumption` (auto-scales with traffic)              |
| **Operating System** | Linux                                                      |
| **Memory Allocated** | 2048 MB  

![json-endpoint](https://github.com/devcaiada/firesightai/blob/main/public/doc/json-endpoint.png?raw=true)

### üìä Endpoint Usage (Last 30 Days)

Using Application Insights, we monitor all traffic and error handling in real time.

‚úÖ Total Requests: 257

üü¢ Successful Predictions: 247

üî¥ Errors Logged: 10

### üîí Azure Function Logic

The gateway logic is written in Python and acts as a secure, authenticated proxy to the Azure ML model endpoint.

```python
import azure.functions as func
import logging
import urllib.request
import json

app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)

EXPECTED_FIELDS = [
    "temperature_2m",
    "relative_humidity_2m",
    "wind_speed_10m",
    "surface_pressure",
    "et0_fao_evapotranspiration",
    "soil_temperature_0_to_7cm",
    "soil_moisture_0_to_7cm",
    "vapour_pressure_deficit",
    "shortwave_radiation_instant",
    "boundary_layer_height"
]

API_URL = "https://wildfire-hackathon-endpoint-v2.eastus2.inference.ml.azure.com/score"
API_KEY = ""

@app.route(route="fire_prediction")
def fire_prediction(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Received request for wildfire prediction.')

    try:
        req_body = req.get_json()
    except ValueError:
        req_body = {key: req.params.get(key) for key in EXPECTED_FIELDS}

    # Verifica se todos os campos esperados est√£o presentes
    missing = [field for field in EXPECTED_FIELDS if field not in req_body]
    if missing:
        return func.HttpResponse(
            f"Missing fields in request: {', '.join(missing)}",
            status_code=400
        )

    try:
        # Cria dicion√°rio com valores convertidos para float
        input_data = {field: float(req_body[field]) for field in EXPECTED_FIELDS}
    except ValueError as e:
        return func.HttpResponse(f"Invalid input format: {e}", status_code=400)

    # Monta o payload no formato esperado pelo modelo
    payload = json.dumps({
        "Inputs": {
            "data": [input_data]
        }
    }).encode("utf-8")

    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
    }

    try:
        request = urllib.request.Request(API_URL, payload, headers)
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(request)
        result = response.read()
        return func.HttpResponse(result.decode("utf-8"), mimetype="application/json")
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
        logging.error(f"Error calling model: {error}")
        return func.HttpResponse(
            f"Model request failed: {error.read().decode('utf-8', 'ignore')}",
            status_code=500
        )
```
